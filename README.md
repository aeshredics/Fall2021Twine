Download the entire Twine .zip and launch the Twine only from the folder you downloaded it in, otherwise some elements such as audio will not function properly.
If you have to download the files individually, place "horse-gallop", "owl-lake-waves", and "questing-beast" all in a folder labeled "audio" (case-sensitive), located in the same place as the "Knighthood" html file.
